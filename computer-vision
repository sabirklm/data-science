# Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Video Analysis in Data Science

This repository provides an overview of key concepts related to computer vision, image processing, and video analysis in the field of data science.

## Computer Vision

**Computer vision** enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world. It involves tasks such as object recognition, image segmentation, facial recognition, and gesture recognition. Machine learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are commonly used in computer vision tasks.

### Applications of Computer Vision:
- Object Recognition
- Image Segmentation
- Facial Recognition
- Gesture Recognition
- Image Captioning
- Medical Image Analysis

## Image Processing

**Image processing** involves manipulating images to enhance their quality or extract useful information. It includes tasks such as image filtering, enhancement, restoration, compression, and feature extraction. Image processing techniques are fundamental to applications like medical imaging and digital photography.

### Common Image Processing Tasks:
- Image Filtering
- Image Enhancement
- Image Restoration
- Image Compression
